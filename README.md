This repository contains the **Oluso** SDK and has the intention to put together as many packages and utilities as possible that solve many of the common problems i' ve been facing during this years of development. I hope that helps some other developers out there.

**What Oluso means?**: Well, the word is from the `Vodoo` language and the real translation is **guardian, keeper** or **celador** on spanish, i am cuban so `Vodoo` language words are part of our common slang, so why not to used to honor mi heritage. Also because the SDK should work a process guardian that provides the desire stability in code, and simplify the development process.
